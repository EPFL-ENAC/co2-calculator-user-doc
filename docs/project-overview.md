### 1.1 CO₂ Calculator objective

Designed in collaboration with labs and experts, the calculator provides a rigorous yet practical way to assess emissions from energy use, travel, equipment, and procurement.

The CO₂ calculator aims to provide labs and EPFL direction with a tool:

- to understand their own carbon footprint (very specific to each research domain)
- to take targeted action
- to visualize the relative impact of different emission sources
- to offer a clearer and more detailed overview of its emissions
- to prepare for upcoming European and national requirements regarding the environmental impact of research projects

### 1.2 EPFL 2030 Climate & Sustainability Strategy and the GreenLabs initiative

The CO₂ Calculator is a key enabler of the [EPFL Climate & Sustainability Strategy](https://www.epfl.ch/about/sustainability/strategy/). It allows EPFL research teams to measure the carbon footprint of research activities as a decision-making tool for mitigation.

The GreenLab initiative is integrated in the EPFL Climate & Sustainability Strategy and aims at engraining sustainability practices in EPFL research labs. Its vision is that “All EPFL laboratories conduct environmentally and socially responsible research without compromising the research quality. Laboratory practices are especially aligned with planetary boundaries.”

There are three objectives as well as targets and actions presented in the figure below. The CO₂ calculator development is a key action to allow a first understanding of the carbon footprint at the lab scale and identify action levers to transform lab operations. Since labs have different needs and functioning, it is essential to develop measures tailored to their carbon footprint and specificities.

### 1.3 Project history and collaborations

- **Initial Prototype (SV):**
  The project began in the Faculty of Life Sciences in 2019, where a CO₂ calculator prototype was developed and tested with around thirty labs. It was then refined and scaled across all EPFL faculties. More details here: [SV‑CO2 Calculator](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sv/school-of-life-sciences/about-us/sv-sustainability-office/co2-calculator/)

- **Towards an Open-Source Tool:**
  Since 2023, the project is part of EPFL’s Climate and Sustainability Strategy, aiming to raise awareness and provide a global overview of research-related emissions by 2026 through an open-source calculator available to all EPFL units and beyond.
